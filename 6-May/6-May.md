### Answer for May 6 challenge

## Jenna at 3540 metres

After calculating individual distances after 1234 seconds, we arrived at the following conclusion.
We also did the calculations manually and confirmed the answer using python.
Our code relies on looping and basic data structures like lists to simulate the race and keep track of the distances. The use of indexing and the max function allows for finding the winner based on the distance travelled. Time complexity of the our code is O(total_time).

John travelled 2880 Metres and was resting for 6 seconds.
James travelled 2432 Metres and was resting for 5 seconds.
Jenna travelled 3540 Metres and was resting for 11 seconds.
Josh travelled 2037 Metres and wasn't resting.
Jacob travelled 1260 Metres and was resting for 6 seconds.
Jerry travelled 2070 Metres and was resting for 10 seconds.

### Therefore the winner was Jenna at 3540 Metres
