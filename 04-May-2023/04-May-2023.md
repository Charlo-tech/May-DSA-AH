### May 4th Answer

## 56th Floor

For this challenge, the answer is 56 th floor. We used for loop in python to iterate through the up and down movements that bring us to the <b>56th floor</b> after going up <b>349 times</b> and down <b>293 times</b>.
The algorithm used is a simple iterative approach where each character in the instructions is processed one by one. For each character, the code checks if it is a left arrow ("<") or a right arrow (">") and adjusts the floor variable accordingly.  Time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the instructions string
