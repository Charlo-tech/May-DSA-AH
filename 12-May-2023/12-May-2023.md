### May 12th Answer

By adding the code for deciphering the code and the provided codephrase to python, we got the following answer:
We use a simple iterative algorithm that goes through the encoded string one bit at a time and checks if the current bit sequence matches any of the codes in the codebook. If it does, the corresponding symbol is added to the decoded string and the current bit sequence is reset.
The data structures used in this algorithm are a string to represent the encoded input, a dictionary to represent the codebook, and another string to represent the decoded output. The dictionary is used to map each code to its corresponding symbol, and the strings are used to store the encoded and decoded data.
Our algorithm has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the encoded string and m is the maximum length of a code in the codebook. The space complexity is also O(n), since we need to store the encoded and decoded strings.
