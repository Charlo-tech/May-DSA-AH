## Minimum cost: 475

Using python, we found the minimum cost of the 39 workers to be <b>475</b> after iterating through possible pairs in the array.
We use a for loop to iterate over the sorted list of workers efficiency ratings and pair the workers with the closest efficiency ratings together and a list to store the costs of each pair of workers. time complexity of our code is O(n log n) due to the sorting algorithm used.
